\section{Introduction}

%What?
We are interested in normalising derivations in systems of propositional logic. To us, normalisation is the elimination of `dead ends' from derivations. An abstract depiction of a dead end is the following
\[
\atomicflow{
( 0  , 4  )*{\afaidnw{}{}};
( 6  , 3  )*{\afvjd6{}a};
( 0  , 2.3)*{\aflabelright{\bar a}};
( 2  , 2  )*{\afvj4};
(-2  , 1  )*{\afvju6a{}};
( 4  ,-2  )*{\afaiunw{}{}};
(-3.5, 0  )*{\invisiblemark};
( 7.5, 0  )*{\invisiblemark}}
\quad,
\]
where the atom $\bar a$ is first created by an axiom and then destroyed by a cut (represented by horizontal bars), hence never reaching the premiss nor the conclusion of the derivation.

%Why?
We believe that understanding normalisation is crucial for solving problems related to complexity and identity of proofs. To argue about these complicated notions a simple language is needed and in particular a language without bureaucracy.

%State of affairs
At the core of our work lies \emph{atomic flows} which were introduced in \cite{GuglGund:07:Normalis:lr}. Atomic flows are graphical representations of derivations which are largely syntax independent and bureaucracy free. It was shown how atomic flows are useful in defining new normal forms and in arguing about normalisation. However, the normalisation procedures presented employed several different techniques and were relatively complicated. To get a more intuitive understanding of the mechanisms at play, something more simplistic was desired.

%How?
Using the language of atomic flows we show in this paper how we can normalise derivations using a simple cut-copy-paste approach. We cut away some parts of a derivation to normalise it, at the expense of destroying it. However, by making many copies, it is possible to paste all the pieces together and create a derivation on normal form.

%Novelty
In \cite{GuglGund:07:Normalis:lr} our focus was on local transformations of derivations and how the atomic flow of a derivation was sufficient to guide normalisation. In this paper we take this further by considering global normalisation procedures. We show that information about the connectedness of axioms and cuts is all that is needed to guide normalisation.

%WOW!
The newfound simplicity allowed us to find a strongly normalising streamlining procedure.

\newcommand{\SKS}{\mathsf{SKS}}
%Constraints
The results in this paper are presented in the deep inference formalism the calculus of structures and system $\SKS$, but we strive at generality and as long as a system has atomic structural rules and linear logical rules (which is expected in deep inference), it should not be difficult to adapt our results.

\section{Streamlining}\label{SectStreamlining}

Streamlining is an up-down symmetric generalisation of cut-elimination, which applies to derivations as well as to proofs. No $\SKS$ rule is, in general, admissible from derivations, so when defining a normal form for derivations we cannot define it based on which rules they contain. We therefore define streamlining based on the shape of the atomic flows associated with derivations. Intuitively a derivation is streamlined if its associated atomic flow contains no `dead ends', where a dead end is a path which does not start at the premiss nor end at the conclusion. We recall the definition from \cite{GuglGund:07:Normalis:lr}:

%---------------------------------------
\begin{defi}
An $\SKS$ derivation is \emph{streamlined} if, in its associated atomic flow, there are no paths from interaction or weakening vertices to cointeraction or coweakening vertices.
\end{defi}

%---------------------------------------
\begin{rem}\label{RemStr}
It immediately follows from the definition that the diagram below describes the shape of a streamlined derivation:
\[
\atomicflow{
(-10,11)*{\afvjm4};
%---
(-15, 5)*{\copy\contrup};
(-10, 5)*{\affr{28}8};
( -5, 5)*{\copy\contrdown};
( 10, 5)*{\copy\interdown};
( 10, 5)*{\affr88};
( 20, 5)*{\copy\weakdown};
( 20, 5)*{\affr88};
%---
(-20, 0)*{\afvjm2};
(-10, 0)*{\afvjm2};
(  0, 0)*{\afvjm2};
( 10, 0)*{\afvjm2};
( 20, 0)*{\afvjm2};
%---
(-20,-5)*{\copy\weakup};
(-20,-5)*{\affr88};
(-10,-5)*{\copy\interup};
(-10,-5)*{\affr88};
(  5,-5)*{\copy\contrup};
( 10,-5)*{\affr{28}8};
( 15,-5)*{\copy\contrdown};
%---
(  10,-11)*{\afvjm4};
}\quad.
\]
\end{rem}

From our point of view, the main challenge in streamlining a derivation is to make sure there are no paths from axioms to cuts. Once this is achieved it is straightforward, as shown in \cite{GuglGund:07:Normalis:lr}, to use (confluent and strongly normalising) weakening reductions to obtain a streamlined derivation. This motivates the following definition:

%---------------------------------------
\begin{defi}
An $\SKS$ derivation is \emph{weakly streamlined} if, in its associated atomic flow, there are no paths from interaction vertices to cointeraction vertices.
\end{defi}

%---------------------------------------
\begin{rem}\label{RemWeakStr}
It immediately follows from the definition that the diagram below describes the shape of a weakly streamlined derivation:
\[
\atomicflow{
(-5, 11)*{\afvjm4};
%---
( -5, 5)*{\affr{18}8};
(-10, 5)*{\copy\contrup};
( -5, 5)*{\copy\weakdown};
(  0, 5)*{\copy\contrdown};
( 10, 5)*{\affr88};
( 10, 5)*{\copy\interdown};
%---
(-10, 0)*{\afvjm2};
(  0, 0)*{\afvjm2};
( 10, 0)*{\afvjm2};
%---
(-10,-5)*{\affr88};
(-10,-5)*{\copy\interup};
(  5,-5)*{\affr{18}8};
(  0,-5)*{\copy\contrup};
(  5,-5)*{\copy\weakup};
( 10,-5)*{\copy\contrdown};
%---
(  5,-11)*{\afvjm4};
}\quad.
\]
\end{rem}

\subsection{The Core}

The \emph{core of a derivation} is what is left after removing the axioms and cuts which causes the derivation not to be weakly streamlined. As can be seen in Definition~\ref{DefFlowCore} below this leaves most of the atomic flow associated with the original derivation untouched. This gives rise to the claim that we can do normalisation with hardly any knowledge about the structure of the derivation we are normalising.

We first define what the core of an atomic flow is and then the definition of the core of a derivation will follow.

\newcommand{\Core}{\mathsf{Core}}

\begin{defi}\label{DefFlowCore}
Given an atomic flow
\[
A=\atomicflow
{
(-21, 8.5)*{\afvjm{9}};
(-13, 8)*{\afaidm{}{}{}{}{}{}};

(-18, 0)*{\affr{8}{8}};
(-16, 2)*{a_1};
( -8, 0)*{\affr{8}{8}};
( -6, 2)*{\bar a_1};

where the subflow of $A$ labelled $a_i$ (resp., $\bar a_i$) is isomorphic to the sublfow of $\Core(A)$ labelled $a_i$ (resp., $\bar a_i$) for every $1\leq i\leq n$ and the rightmost subflow of $A$ is isomorphic to the rightmost sublfow of $\Core(A)$.
\end{defi}

We now define the core of a derivation. The core is weakly streamlined at the expense of new atoms in the premiss and conclusion. In the next section we will see how we can glue several cores together to eliminate these atoms, but still obtain a weakly streamlined derivation.

\begin{defi}\label{DefCore}
Given a derivation $\vlder{\Phi}{}{\beta}{\alpha}$ with associated atomic flow $A$, a \emph{core of\/ $\Phi$} is defined to be a derivation $\vlder{\Core(\Phi)}{}{\vls[\beta.(a_n.{\bar a_n}).\cdots.(a_1.{\bar a_1})]}{\vls([a_1.{\bar a_1}].\cdots.[a_n.{\bar a_n}].\alpha)}$ with associated atomic flow $\Core(A)$.
\end{defi}

To obtain the core of a derivation is straightforward, but a detailed proof can be found in the full version of this paper.

\begin{thm}
Given a derivation $\vlder{\Phi}{}{\beta}{\alpha}$, $\Core(\Phi)$ exists.
\end{thm}

\subsection{The Normaliser}

We now show how to build a weakly streamlined derivation. We present the \emph{normaliser}, which is a `skeleton' where we can plug copies of the core of the derivation we want to normalise. The novelty of this method is that no knowledge of the shape of the core is required. The only information needed to build the normaliser is the number of atoms which must be eliminated from the premiss and conclusion of the core in order to obtain the desired derivation.

\newcommand{\contr}{\mathsf{c}}
\newcommand{\cod}{{\contr{\downarrow}}}
\newcommand{\cou}{{\contr{\uparrow}}}

\newcommand{\Norm}{\mathsf{Norm}}

\begin{defi}
The \emph{normaliser}, $\Norm(\Phi,a_1,\dots,a_n)$, is an operator taking as input a sequence of atoms and a derivation of the form
\[
\vlder{\Phi}{}{\vls[\beta.(a_n.{\bar a_n}).\cdots.(a_1.{\bar a_1})]}{\vls([a_1.{\bar a_1}].\cdots.[a_n.{\bar a_n}].\alpha)}\quad,
\]
where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are formulae and returning a derivation of the form
\[
\vlder{\Norm(\Phi,a_1,\dots,a_n)}{}{\beta}{\alpha}\quad.
\]

We define $\Norm$ inductively on the number of arguments. Let $\Norm(\Phi)=\Phi$ and for $n>0$ let $\Norm(\Phi,a_1,\dots,a_n)$ be
\newbox\DeltaTopK
\setbox\DeltaTopK=
\hbox{$

 \vlde{\Norm(\Phi,a_1,\dots,a_{n-1})}{}{\vls[\beta.(\vlinf{\awu}{}{\ttt}{a_n}.\bar a_n)]}

 }
}$
}

 }
}$
}

\setbox\DeltaK=

 }
}$
}
\[

 {
  \vlin{\swi}{}{\vls[\vlinf{\cod}{}{\beta}{\vls[\beta.\beta]}.\box\DeltaBotK]}

}\quad.

\end{defi}

\begin{pro}\label{PropFlowNorm}
If the atomic flow of
\[\vlder{\Norm(\Phi,a_1,\dots,a_{n-1})}{}{\vls[\beta.(a_n.\bar a_n)]}{\vls([a_n.\bar a_n].\alpha)}

\end{pro}

By studying Definition~\ref{DefFlowCore} and Proposition~\ref{PropFlowNorm} we can see how a weakly streamlined derivation can be built. The proof is given in the full version of this paper.

\begin{thm}
Given a derivation $\vlder{\Phi}{}{\beta}{\alpha}$, there are atoms $a_1,\dots,a_n$ in $\Phi$ such that $\vlder{\Norm(\Core(\Phi),a_1,\dots,a_n)}{}{\beta}{\alpha}$ is weakly streamlined.
